## Considerations

The user will be able to select the same driver for anything except for different final positions within the same race. So if the user predicts that Hamilton will win the race, he can predict that he will also win the pole position, fastest lap, fastest pit stop, etc. But if the user predicts that Hamilton will finish the race in second place, he cannot predict that he will also finish the race in third place.
